        The process of deciding what and how to cook, especially when trying to optimize the use of available ingredients, 
                    can be confusing and time-consuming. Our product will address this practical need in everyday life by 
                    leveraging the power of object detection and large language models to simplify and enhance the cooking 
                    experience for home cooks. Utilizing GPT-4 Vision, our product will allow users to input an image of 
                    groceries, create a list of available ingredients, and then search a database of recipes that use those 
                    ingredients. Additionally, and AI chat bot will guide users through each step of the process, 
                    such as allowing user input for additional ingredients and guiding them through the steps of 
                    the recipe. This innovative approach combines computer vision, search, 
                    and large language models to enhance the user experience in the kitchen.
